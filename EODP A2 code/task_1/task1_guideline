task 1 data pre-processing: 4 person

aim: make sure data are balanced and no missing values and unreliable outliers 

Possible Methods:
    1. value_counts() to see if the number balanced -->plot a bar chart to see the differernce
    2. percentage of missing value in one column --> remove the whole column or fill in with (mean/median/mode)
    3. outiler detection using box-plot or Z-score --> may remove outliers
    4. feature engineering --> convert the numerical data into categorical data
    5. merge files


step 1: target variables
    1.1. separate the [level of injurity] into 3 categoties  - KAY
    1.2. separate the [severity] and separate into 3 categories column - KEMAN LI

in addition: plot a bar chart to show the number of accident for each category
    
possible categories: 
    1: serious
    2: minor 
    3: not injured 

step 2: feature variables
    2.1: remove columns / Fill in columns
    2.3: delete columns that is unrelated or not useful
