supervised learning model - supervised learning: 2 person

aim: training and generate a prediction model

possible methods:
    step1. feature selection via random forest/regerssion model (may include encoding)
    step2. use 5 fold stratified cross-validation to measure the performance of the model

possible machine learning models: 
    1. random forest/decision tree - categotical
    2. logistic regression/other models

- severity is a cate, so we choose random forest, results show the top ten importance
- data is unbalance, so we upsample, our model is higher than basedline so good enough
- before upsampling f1 score for fatal is low, sample low so model doesnst have enough data to learn, after upsampling, f1 score 
higher so it improves 
-logistic regression model accuracy is low as its better for linear relationships
- evaluate confusion matrix
- decision tree risk profile analysis
- TARE_WEIGHT, VEHICLE_YEAR_MANUF try to find linear relationship with severity
