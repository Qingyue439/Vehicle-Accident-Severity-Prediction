aim: Discovering High-Risk Vehicle Profiles via Severity-Oriented Clustering

(almost the same logic as assignment 1 task 3, only differernce is we change y from number of crashes to severity)

possible methods: 
1. kmeans
2. PCA

note: pca first or cluster first?

possible groups: 
    1. Compact Commuters (4 seats, lightest weight)
    2. Utility Beasts (4 seats, relatively heavy)
    3. Family Movers (6-8 seats)
    4. Heavy Haulers (multiple wheels, Diesel, Heavy Duty)
    5. Public transport (professional driver, slow speed)
